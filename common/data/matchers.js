	/**
	 * These are the `filters.custom` in "characters\js\table.js", used to "match"
	 * ability descriptions in "common\data\details.js"
	 *
	 * # Properties:
	 * * `name` {string} - Description of the filter that will appear in the sidebar
	 *      in the Character Table
	 * * `target` {string} - The property of an object in `window.details` (see
	 *      "common\data\details.js") that will be matched against `matcher`.
	 * * `matcher` {RegExp} - Regex that will be used to match against `target`. For
	 *      performance and readability purposes, use non-capturing regex groups if
	 *      that group is not matched by any submatcher. It also makes counting
	 *      groups easier (firefox only started supporting named capture groups in
	 *      2020). Do not use lookbehind regexes as they are not supported by Safari
	 *      on iOS, as of 2022. Do learn what the differences of "greedy" and "lazy"
	 *      quantifiers are.
	 * * `submatchers` [{object[]}] - optional array of submatchers. These are used
	 *      for matching the captured groups by the regex for further filtering of
	 *      units. For example, you can filter a unit by its special, specifying its
	 *      multiplier and the number of turns.
	 *
	 * ## Submatcher properties:
	 * * `type` {string} - type of the submatcher. Can be one of the following:
	 * * * "number" - a numerical value that can be compared with "<", ">", "<=",
	 *          ">=", and "=". May be floating-point (so allow that in the regexes where
	 *          there are decimal values). Can also be "completely" or "99+", in which case it
	 *          will be interpreted as Infinity for comparing (make sure that it is in a
	 *          captured group too). This shows up in the sidebar as a label with an
	 *          input text field. Make sure the captured group does not include spaces.
	 *          "?"'s in the captured groups will be replaced by "0" for comparison,
	 *          so that they will be filtered when the filter is on, but won't be
	 *          included when the user searches for specific numbers (unless they search
	 *          for "=0" or "<1").
	 * * * "text" - same as "number", but it matches any text (case-insensitive)
	 *          against the specified groups. This actually supports regex, so
	 *          "luffy|yamato" could be used
	 * * * "option" - matches a regex against the specified `groups`. This shows up
	 *          as a toggleable filter. If the submatcher needs to check if an optional
	 *          group was NOT captured, use the regex /^$/ (empty string). Try to
	 *          optimize them by using `^` (start of string) where applicable, and pick
	 *          shorter keywords. For example, if you need to match the phrase "on the
	 *          supported character", you can include that whole phrase as an optional
	 *          group, but your submatcher regex will just be /./ (any character), so it
	 *          will only check for only one character. If you want a set of options to
	 *          be mutually exclusive (up to only one of them can be active), specify a
	 *          `radioGroup` that they will share.
	 * * * "separator" - a submatcher that doesn't do anything except show some text
	 * * `description` - a string that indicates what the text field of a number-type
	 *      submatcher is for (appears on the left of it) or the text that will show
	 *      up on an option-type submatcher.
	 * * `regex` - a RegExp object used by "option"-type submatchers to check
	 *      against the specified group.
	 * * `radioGroup` - any string that will be used to identify a group of options,
	 *      so that enabling one will turn off all other options that share the same
	 *      `radioGroup`.
	 * * `groups` - an array of indexes (numbers) of the captured group(s) that will
	 *      be matched by the submatcher `regex` or the number the user entered. For
	 *      abilities that may remove an effect's duration completely or by x turns,
	 *      it may be necessary to specify two group indexes, one for the finite "x"
	 *      turns, another for the completely (because we don't say
	 *      "by completely turns"). Note that captured groups have 1-based indexes,
	 *      because the 0th group is the whole string captured by the whole regex.
	 * * `cssClasses` - optional array of strings of css class names to apply to the
	 *      submatcher div. If not provided, they will be given the 'min-width-12'
	 *      class (because the parent div is a flexbox, allowing options to be
	 *      placed beside each other to save space). If provided, the given array
	 *      will be used and will not be given the default class (unless it is also
	 *      in the given array)
	 *
	 * Matchers and submatchers are evaluated in CharUtils.checkMatcher in
	 * "characters\js\utils.js". Also see `directives.addTags` in "characters\js\directives.js".
	 *
	 * # Regex Notes:
	 * * You can test your regexes at https://regex101.com/, especially with
	 *      complex ones
	 * * Many target properties are JSON stringified as they can be objects, like
	 *      when a support character has multiple sailor abilities. As such, the
	 *      string will be evaluated against a string that may contain quotes.
	 *      To prevent a regex from matching across two separate sailor abilities,
	 *      make sure to exclude quotes when matching any character (i.e. [^"]+
	 *      instead of .+)
	 * * Also exclude dots so that the regex doesn't match across sentences, so use
	 *      [^."]+
	 * * The regexes assume that the words "공격력", "HP", and "RCV" will appear in
	 *      in this order. The only forms expected are the following:
	 *      ATK|HP|RCV|ATK and HP|ATK and RCV|HP and RCV|ATK, HP and RCV
	 * * JS does not support atomic groups nor possessive quantifiers (.++) but it
	 *      has a workaround.
	 *      Atomic group - `(?>...)`
	 *      Workaround - `(?=(...))\1`  (http://www.rexegg.com/regex-tricks.html#pseudo-atomic-groups)
	 *      The reason some filters (mainly atk, hp, and rcv boosts) need this is
	 *      that this prevents A LOT of backtracking when a certain part of a
	 *      pattern isn't matched. You can make a regex that will match successfully,
	 *      but the simple ones will take a lot of steps to "fail" because of
	 *      backtracking.
	 *      For example (simplified), `Boosts ATK of ([^."]*?)characters by (\d+)x for (\d+) turn`
	 *      There are a few units that boost statically, like #613's "Boosts ATK and
	 *      RCV of all characters by 45 for 1 turn, amplifies the effect of orbs of
	 *      all characters by 2x for 1 turn" (try making a multiplicative ATK boost
	 *      filter that doesn't match this), which will
	 *      fail when the regex encounters the `x` in the multiplier part of the
	 *      regex, so it backtracks to the `[^."]*?` part, which will give back
	 *      every character it captured AND recheck, just to try if the regex will still match,
	 *      so this results in a lot of backtracking (like hundreds or even thousands
	 *      of extra steps).
	 *      This also results in them trying to match for another "by x" in the
	 *      string, so it could give a false positive when there is a different buff
	 *      in the string.
	 *      Give http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quantifiers.html#explicit_greed a read
	 *      (regex experience required)
	 *      The resulting regexes may seem more complicated, but it's a lot more
	 *      efficient and will prevent the regex from "jumping over the fence".
	 *      The key to seeing the performance difference here is to check how few
	 *      steps it requires to match and to fail (as in not trying further).
	 *
	 * # Common Patterns
	 * * by ([?.\d]+)x(?:-([?.\d]+)x)?
	 * * * should match "by ?x", "by 2.5-3.5x", "by 2.?x"
	 * * for ([?\d]+\+?)(?:-([?\d]+))? turns?
	 * * * should match "for ? turns", "for 2-3 turns", "for 99+ turns"
	 * * by ([?.\d]+)x(?:-([?.\d]+)x)?(?:, by ([?.\d]+)x(?:-([?.\d]+)x)?)?
	 * * * doubled multiplier regex, allowing for an optional "otherwise" clause
	 * * for ([?\d]+\+?)(?:-([?\d]+))? turns?(?:, for ([?\d]+\+?)(?:-([?\d]+))? turns?)?
	 * * * double turns regex
	 * * by ([?.\d]+)x(?:-([?.\d]+)x)? for ([?\d]+\+?)(?:-([?\d]+))? turns?(?:, by ([?.\d]+)x(?:-([?.\d]+)x)?(?: for ([?\d]+\+?)(?:-([?\d]+))? turns?)?)?
	 * * * this simply combines the first two, and doubles it for an optional "otherwise" clause
	 * * * should match "by 2x-3x for 1-2 turns, by 1.5-2.5x for 1-2 turns instead"
	 * * (?:by ([?\d]+)(?:-([?\d]+))? turns?|(completely))
	 * * * mostly for status effect reducers, should accept "by 1-3 turns" or "completely"
	 * * * (interpreted as Infinity for comparison). This does not accept "by 99+ turns" since "completely" is used for them
	 * * of (?=((?:(?=([^c."]+))\2|c(?!har))*))\1characters?
	 * * of (?=((?:[^c."]+|c(?!har))*))\1characters?
	 * * * explicit greedy alternation, with a workaround for atomic groups. either is usable
	 * * * the first one is what is in the guide, the second one is my simplified version (no need for the first atomic group)
	 * * * this is basically /of ([^."]*?)characters?/, but prevents backtracking when the next parts of the pattern are not met, potentially leading to false positives.
	 * * * for example, "boosts base atk of all characters by 1000, boosts atk of all characters by 1.5x"
	 * * * this could be matched if the regex for the base atk uses /by ([?.\d]+)x/
